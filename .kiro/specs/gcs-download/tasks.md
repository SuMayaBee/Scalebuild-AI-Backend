# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create GCS download module structure and models
  - Create directory structure for the GCS download module
  - Define Pydantic models for request/response validation
  - Implement URL validation logic with proper error handling
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement GCS download service with URL parsing
  - Create GCSDownloadService class with URL parsing functionality
  - Implement method to extract bucket name and file path from GCS URLs
  - Add content-type detection based on file extensions
  - Write unit tests for URL parsing and content-type detection
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_

- [ ] 3. Implement file download functionality
  - Extend GCSDownloadService with file retrieval from GCS buckets
  - Integrate with existing StorageService credentials and client
  - Implement proper error handling for GCS operations
  - Write unit tests for download service methods
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.7, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Create FastAPI route handler with streaming response
  - Implement POST endpoint that accepts GCS URL and returns file content
  - Use StreamingResponse for efficient memory usage with large files
  - Set appropriate headers (Content-Type, Content-Disposition) for downloads
  - Implement comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 4.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Add route integration and error response formatting
  - Register the new router in main.py following existing patterns
  - Ensure consistent error response format with rest of application
  - Add proper OpenAPI documentation and type hints
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.5, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Write comprehensive tests for the complete feature
  - Create integration tests for the full download flow
  - Test error scenarios (invalid URLs, missing files, auth failures)
  - Add tests for different file types and content-type detection
  - Test streaming response behavior and memory efficiency
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 3.3, 3.4_
