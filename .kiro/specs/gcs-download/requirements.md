# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to download files from Google Cloud Storage buckets within the application. The functionality will provide secure, authenticated access to GCS resources with proper error handling and user feedback. This capability will integrate with the existing application architecture to allow users to retrieve stored files, documents, images, and other assets from their GCS buckets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to download files by providing a GCS file URL, so that I can easily retrieve files without specifying bucket and path separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid GCS file URL THEN the system SHALL parse the URL to extract bucket name and file path
2. WHEN the URL is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL authenticate with Google Cloud Storage using service account credentials
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL retrieve the requested file from the specified bucket
4. WHEN the file is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL return the file content with appropriate headers for download
5. IF the provided URL is not a valid GCS URL format THEN the system SHALL return a validation error with clear messaging
6. IF the user lacks proper permissions THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error with clear messaging
7. IF the requested file does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a not found error with descriptive information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback about download operations, so that I can understand the status and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a download request is initiated THEN the system SHALL validate the bucket name and file path format
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return specific error messages indicating the validation issue
3. WHEN a download is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate status indicators
4. WHEN a download completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return the file with correct MIME type and filename
5. WHEN network or service errors occur THEN the system SHALL return user-friendly error messages with retry suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the GCS download functionality to be secure and properly configured, so that sensitive data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load GCS credentials from secure environment variables or service account files
2. WHEN processing download requests THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions before accessing GCS resources
3. WHEN handling credentials THEN the system SHALL never expose sensitive authentication information in logs or responses
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate details for debugging without exposing sensitive data
5. IF credentials are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL handle authentication failures gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the GCS download functionality to integrate seamlessly with the existing application, so that it follows established patterns and conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL follow the existing FastAPI route structure and patterns
2. WHEN creating new services THEN they SHALL integrate with the current dependency injection and configuration system
3. WHEN handling responses THEN the system SHALL use consistent error response formats with the rest of the application
4. WHEN adding new endpoints THEN they SHALL include proper OpenAPI documentation and type hints
5. WHEN implementing file operations THEN the system SHALL handle large files efficiently without memory issues
