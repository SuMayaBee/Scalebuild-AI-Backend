# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the migration from the current SMTP-based email service to Resend, a modern email API service. The goal is to replace all existing email functionality with Resend's API while maintaining the same endpoints and functionality for the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the current SMTP email service with Resend API, so that I have more reliable email delivery and better developer experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to send an email THEN it SHALL use Resend API instead of SMTP
2. WHEN Resend API is configured THEN the system SHALL authenticate using API key from environment variables
3. WHEN email sending fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with Resend-specific error details
4. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL validate that Resend API key is properly configured

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want all existing email endpoints to continue working exactly the same way, so that no changes are needed in frontend applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling POST /email/send THEN the endpoint SHALL work identically to current implementation
2. WHEN calling POST /email/contact THEN the endpoint SHALL work identically to current implementation  
3. WHEN calling POST /email/welcome THEN the endpoint SHALL work identically to current implementation
4. WHEN calling GET /email/health THEN the endpoint SHALL return Resend service status
5. WHEN any email endpoint is called THEN the request/response format SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Resend using environment variables, so that I can easily manage email service credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the service THEN it SHALL use RESEND_API_KEY environment variable
2. WHEN RESEND_API_KEY is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN the service initializes THEN it SHALL validate the API key format
4. WHEN environment is updated THEN the service SHALL use new credentials without code changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send HTML and plain text emails through Resend, so that I can create rich email content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending custom emails THEN the system SHALL support both HTML and plain text content
2. WHEN HTML content is provided THEN Resend SHALL render it properly
3. WHEN only plain text is provided THEN Resend SHALL send plain text email
4. WHEN both HTML and text are provided THEN Resend SHALL send multipart email

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use email templates with Resend, so that I can maintain consistent email formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending welcome emails THEN the system SHALL use a structured template format
2. WHEN sending contact form emails THEN the system SHALL format them consistently
3. WHEN template data is provided THEN Resend SHALL populate template variables correctly
4. WHEN template rendering fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to plain text with error handling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging for email operations, so that I can troubleshoot email delivery issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Resend API returns an error THEN the system SHALL log the specific error details
2. WHEN API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL return 500 error with authentication message
3. WHEN recipient email is invalid THEN the system SHALL return 400 error with validation message
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 error with retry information
5. WHEN email is sent successfully THEN the system SHALL log success with message ID

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all SMTP-related code and dependencies, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is complete THEN all SMTP-related imports SHALL be removed
2. WHEN migration is complete THEN all SMTP configuration variables SHALL be removed from .env
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN smtplib dependencies SHALL be removed
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN only Resend-related code SHALL remain in email service
