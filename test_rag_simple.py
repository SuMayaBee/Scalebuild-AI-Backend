    Python Programming Guide
    
    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
    It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
    
    Key Features of Python:
    1. Easy to learn and use - Python has a simple syntax that makes it accessible to beginners
    2. Interpreted language - No need to compile code before running
    3. Object-oriented programming - Supports classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation
    4. Large standard library - Comes with many built-in modules and functions
    5. Cross-platform compatibility - Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems
    6. Dynamic typing - Variables don't need explicit type declarations
    
    Popular Use Cases:
    - Web development with frameworks like Django and Flask
    - Data science and machine learning with libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn
    - Artificial intelligence and deep learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch
    - Automation and scripting for system administration
    - Desktop application development with tkinter or PyQt
    - Game development with pygame
    
    Python Philosophy:
    The Zen of Python includes principles like:
    - Beautiful is better than ugly
    - Explicit is better than implicit
    - Simple is better than complex
    - Readability counts
    
    Getting Started:
    To start programming in Python, you need to install Python from python.org
    and choose a code editor or IDE like VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE.
